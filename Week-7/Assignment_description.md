# 📝 Assignment Description - Week 7

## 🎯 Task Overview

In Week 7 of my internship at **Celebal Tech**, I was assigned the task of developing an interactive **web application using Streamlit** to deploy a trained machine learning model. The goal was to enable users to input data, receive real-time predictions, and interpret model behavior through intuitive visualizations — effectively bridging the gap between data science and end users.

---

## 📌 Task Objectives

Build and deploy a Streamlit web application that:

1. **Loads a Trained Machine Learning Model**
   - Load a pre-trained `.pkl` or `.joblib` model using `pickle` or `joblib`.
   - Ensure compatibility with user input format.

2. **Accepts User Input**
   - Design a user-friendly sidebar or input form using Streamlit widgets like:
     - `st.text_input`, `st.number_input`, `st.selectbox`, etc.
   - Collect feature values required by the model for making predictions.

3. **Generates Predictions**
   - Use the model to make predictions based on user input.
   - Display predictions clearly using `st.success`, `st.info`, or similar.

4. **Includes Visualizations**
   - Show feature importance, distribution of predictions, or other relevant charts using:
     - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, or `plotly`
   - Include examples or demo data if needed for better interpretation.

5. **Application Structure**
   - Maintain modular and readable code (e.g., separate model loading and prediction functions).
   - Ensure the UI is clean, informative, and interactive.

6. **Deployment (Optional)**
   - Deploy the app to a cloud platform (e.g., Streamlit Cloud) if feasible.

## 🗃 Deliverables

- `week7_streamlit_app.py`: Python script containing the complete Streamlit app.
- `best_model.pkl`: Pre-trained machine learning model used in the application.
- `encoders.pkl`: Encoders for data preprocessing.
- `requirements.txt`: List of all dependencies required to run the Streamlit app.
- `datasets` for testing or demonstrating the app with sample input.
