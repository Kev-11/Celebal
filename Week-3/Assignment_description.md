# 📝 Assignment Description - Week 3

## 🎯 Task Overview

In Week 3 of my internship at **Celebal Tech**, I was assigned to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Data Visualization** on a dataset related to **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)**. The goal was to extract insights, understand patterns in assessment and demographic data, and prepare the dataset for potential future modeling tasks.

## 📌 Task Objectives

Perform EDA and visualization on an ASD dataset by completing the following:

1. **Import Necessary Libraries**
   - Use `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `sklearn.preprocessing`.

2. **Load the Dataset**
   - Load the dataset using `pandas.read_csv()` and display initial samples.
   - Understand data types, missing values, and value distributions.

3. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing/null values appropriately.
   - Encode categorical columns using `LabelEncoder` or mapping techniques.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Summary statistics using `.describe()`, `.info()`, etc.
   - Group-wise analysis (e.g., gender-wise ASD cases).
   - Correlation analysis using a heatmap.

5. **Visualizations**
   - Bar plots, histograms, and count plots for categorical distributions.
   - Pairplots or scatter plots for numerical relations.
   - Correlation matrix using `seaborn.heatmap()`.

6. **Documentation**
   - Explain each step with markdown cells.
   - Include findings and visual observations throughout the notebook.
