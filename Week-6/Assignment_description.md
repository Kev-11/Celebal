# 📝 Assignment Description - Week 6

## 🎯 Task Overview

In Week 6 of my internship at **Celebal Tech**, I was assigned to build and evaluate **multiple machine learning classification models**. The focus was on comparing model performance using a range of evaluation metrics and enhancing their predictive capabilities through **hyperparameter tuning**. The end goal was to identify the best-performing model based on empirical evidence.

## 📌 Task Objectives

This assignment involves implementing the complete classification pipeline, including model training, evaluation, and optimization. The key steps include:

1. **Model Training**
   - Train multiple classification models using scikit-learn such as:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Tree Classifier
     - Random Forest Classifier
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

2. **Model Evaluation**
   - Use appropriate train-test split or cross-validation.
   - Evaluate models using the following metrics:
     - **Accuracy**
     - **Precision**
     - **Recall**
     - **F1-Score**
   - Generate confusion matrices and classification reports for each model.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Apply:
     - **GridSearchCV**: For exhaustive parameter search
     - **RandomizedSearchCV**: For randomized and faster tuning
   - Optimize model parameters for improved performance.

4. **Model Selection**
   - Compare evaluation metrics across models.
   - Select the best-performing model based on F1-score and overall balance.
   - Justify the model choice using both quantitative metrics and qualitative analysis.
