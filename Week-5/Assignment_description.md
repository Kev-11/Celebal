# 📝 Assignment Description - Week 5

## 🎯 Task Overview

In Week 5 of my internship at **Celebal Tech**, I was assigned the task of performing **regression analysis** on the **House Prices Prediction Dataset** provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). The goal was to predict the sale prices of residential homes based on a wide variety of features and to extract meaningful insights that lead to accurate modeling.

## 📌 Task Objectives

Perform end-to-end regression modeling by completing the following steps:

1. **Dataset Acquisition**
   - Download and load the dataset from Kaggle (both `train.csv` and `test.csv`).
   - Understand the structure, features, and target variable (`SalePrice`).

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values through appropriate imputation techniques.
   - Encode categorical features using Label Encoding and/or One-Hot Encoding.
   - Normalize or scale numerical features where necessary.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize relationships between features and target variable.
   - Identify multicollinearity and highly correlated variables.
   - Use plots like histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps, and boxplots.

4. **Feature Selection & Engineering**
   - Drop redundant or unimportant features.
   - Create new features if needed for performance improvement.

5. **Model Building**
   - Apply regression algorithms such as:
     - Linear Regression
     - Decision Tree or Random Forest Regressor
     - XgBoost Regressor
   - Use train-test split or cross-validation techniques for evaluation.

6. **Prediction & Submission**
   - Generate predictions for the test dataset.
   - Format the submission file as per Kaggle guidelines (if applicable).

## 🗃 Deliverables

- `model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing:
  - Data loading, cleaning, EDA, modeling, evaluation, and final predictions
  - Clear markdown explanations and visualizations

- `Datasets/`: Folder containing the original `train.csv`, `test.csv`, and any processed files

- `submission.csv`: Final prediction file (optional, if submitted on Kaggle)
