# 📝 Assignment Description - Week 2

## 🎯 Task Overview

In Week 2 of my internship at **Celebal Tech**, I was assigned the task of implementing a **singly linked list** in Python. This assignment focused on understanding object-oriented programming, class-based design, and exception handling. The aim was to create a custom data structure from scratch and implement basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

## 📌 Task Objectives

Write a Python program that:

1. Defines a `Node` class to store individual data elements.
2. Implements a `LinkedList` class with the following methods:
   - `add(data)` – to insert new elements at the end of the list
   - `print_list()` – to print the entire linked list
   - `delete(index)` – to delete an element at a specified 1-based index, with proper error handling
3. Demonstrates the functionality with sample data, including:
   - Adding multiple elements to the list
   - Printing the list
   - Deleting a valid index
   - Attempting to delete an invalid index (to show error handling)
